The Odin Project, Rock Paper Scissors game

Things to Add when I Improve as a Programmer:
  - Global score (matches) after each game (hierarchy is round -> game -> match)
  - More dynamic UI, like messages after each round or each game
  - Play again has a button after each game, no need to refresh

Any suggestions? Please let me know, and I'd love to hear any feedback!
